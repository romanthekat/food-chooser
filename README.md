meaningless_food_chooser
========================

Small and kinda useless 'tool' that helps you to choose what exactly you should cook for breakfast or lunch.<br>

Whole 'application', that 'problem' is completely far-fetched, the only reason - to use at least somehow such things like MongoDB, Redis, junit+mockito, java 8 stream api.


##### Prerequisites at the moment:
* MongoDB on localhost on default port for dishes
* Redis on localhost on default port for tags presets
